# Weather-app
In this project i'm using different techonogies such as Webpack, and sass.
if you download the project, make sure tu go to the dist folder and add the script for Modernizr.
this script will allow you to ask the user permision to get their location. 

I used [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) as my API. you need to create an account and get a **key** for your project.

you will need **dist** folder and inside that dist folder, create an **css** folder. also you will need to paste your **images** folder that is inside of source and paste it into the **dist** folder



You will also need to do:
```
npm run install
```
# later i will update the way it is set up that way i become more easier for you!
